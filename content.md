# Quality Assurance & Testing ü™≥

## Introduction
In the world of software development, ensuring that your application functions as intended is not just beneficial‚Äîit's crucial. Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing are the safeguards that help maintain the integrity, performance, and reliability of your application.

## Functional Testing vs Non-functional Testing
The major difference between these categories of Software Testing is that Functional Testing tests the functionality of a software product while non-functional testing concentrates on performance and security.

### Functional Testing
- Unit testing
- API testing
- UI testing
- Integration testing
- Regression testing
- Compatibility testing with different devices and platforms
- End-to-end testing

### Non-Functional Testing
- Security testing
- Performance testing

## Benefits of QA Testing
QA testing provides numerous benefits, including:

- **Improved software quality**: Identifies and eliminates defects, ensuring the software meets required quality standards.
- **Reduced risk**: Minimizes the risk of software failures, downtime, and reputational damage.
- **Increased user satisfaction**: Ensures the software meets the requirements and expectations of end-users.
- **Cost savings**: Reduces the cost of software maintenance and support by identifying and fixing issues early on.

By understanding the importance of QA testing and following best practices, you can ensure the quality and reliability of your software products or services, leading to increased user satisfaction and business success.

## Types of QA Testing

[Source](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep83-explaining-9-types-of-api-testing)

There are various types of QA testing, including:
<!-- TODO: provide how-to guides -->
- **Smoke Testing**: Verifies critical functionalities and identifies show-stopper issues.
- **Manual Testing**: Traditional method of testing, often used for complex or creative testing scenarios.
- **Automation Testing**: Uses software tools (like [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)) to execute tests and reduce testing time and effort.
- **Regression Testing**: Verifies that changes or fixes did not introduce new defects or affect existing functionality.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests how different components or systems interact with each other.
- **System Testing**: Tests the entire software system, including all its components and interactions.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Verifies that the software meets the requirements and expectations of the end-users. (sometimes called "beta" testing)

<!-- 
### Performance Testing
Ensure your application performs well under stress and high traffic by using tools like:

- [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/): Monitors and tunes the performance of your application.
- [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/): Tests performance both on static and dynamic resources.

## Best Practices for QA Testing

To ensure the effectiveness of QA testing, follow these best practices:

- **Plan and prioritize testing**: Identify critical test cases and prioritize them based on risk and business impact.
- **Use automation testing**: Leverage automation testing to reduce testing time and effort.
- **Involve stakeholders**: Involve stakeholders, including developers, product managers, and end-users, in the testing process.
- **Continuously test and iterate**: Continuously test and iterate throughout the development process to ensure the software meets the required quality standards.

## The QA process
A good QA process checks whether the product meets your specifications and needs. While software testing can vary slightly depending on the company‚Äôs practices, the main stages remain the same:

- **Analysis of Requirements**: QA analysts review and analyze the specific requirements of a project. They develop clarity on the parameters of their involvement. Analyzing requirements is crucial as it sets the framework for effective and executable quality control.

<aside>
Creating a Functional Specification document is critical. It guides both developers and QA teams on what needs to be tested and assures that all features work as intended. This document should detail:

- **User Stories**: What the user can do with the application.
- **Expected Behaviors**: How the application should behave under various conditions.
- **Edge Cases**: Special cases or unusual conditions that need handling.
</aside>

- **Planning**: QA professionals start the test planning phase once they have a good understanding of project requirements. They must define the scope of their work and come up with a testing strategy specific to the project. Planning also involves laying out the QA approach for each stage of the software engineering cycle, the type of testing called for, and the tools required.
- **Test Case Development**: A test case is a combination of actions that must be performed on a system to ensure it functions correctly. It ensures that separate features within software fall within applicable guidelines and standards. Test case development sets out step-by-step processes for each testing sequence and includes checklists for both manual and automated testing methods.
- **Test Execution**: This is the process of executing the prepared test cases and determining the differences between expected and actual results. It involves capturing test results and reporting bugs, errors, and other problems. QA testers create additional sub-tests to test these issues. Final test results are brought before the team members for further action.
- **Verification**: This involves retesting the product once the development team has fixed all issues brought up in the test execution stage. Verification involves regression testing and analysis, where QA testers check if identified bugs have been successfully resolved and whether new bugs have appeared. The verification process ensures the optimal functionality of the product.
- **Documentation and Reporting**: This stage involves preparing a document outlining all tests conducted during the product development cycle, along with their results. It provides detailed insights into the number and nature of errors and anomalies detected. The document lists the entire chronology of the testing process and can be used to reinforce future product testing cycles.

## End-to-End Testing
End-to-end testing (E2E testing) is the process of testing a piece of software from start to finish as it will be used by the actual users. For a web application, you would start a browser, navigate to the correct URL, use the application as intended, and verify the behavior. This usually happens in a staging or test environment before going into production.

### Practical steps to get started with E2E testing
1. Identify test scenarios
2. Map the steps in each scenario
3. Use the mapped steps to perform manual testing
4. Automate the tests
5. Add your tests to the CI pipeline

Get together with business owners, developers, and testers and think about some scenarios that you want to test before every release. This doesn‚Äôt have to be an exhaustive list. It‚Äôs better to have a minimal set running first, and then expand on it later.

### End-to-End Testing Example
Here‚Äôs an example of a (manual) E2E test:

1. Go to https://demoblaze.com.
2. Click on the first product (the Samsung Galaxy s6 phone, with a price of $360.)
3. On the product‚Äôs page, ensure the name and the price of the product are correct.
4. Then, click on the ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù button.
5. Ensure you see an alert with the message ‚ÄúProduct added.‚Äù
6. Click on the ‚ÄúCart‚Äù link, in the main navigation menu.
7. Ensure the cart has a single product with the correct info, and the total is $360.
8. Finally, click on the ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù link and verify whether the product got deleted.

This is a simple test case for testing whether the cart functionality of an e-commerce site works as intended. With a test automation tool, you could automate this test to prevent future regressions.

## Automated vs Manual Testing

tldr; you should automate every test that you can, and manually test what you can't automate.

### Manual Testing
- Cost depends on human resources deployed in testing.
- Slower and prone to human errors.
- Not suited for many types of testing (like stress testing).
- Hard to test complex cases manually.
- Good for finding visual or UX bugs.

### Automated Testing
- More reliable and quicker than manual testing.
- Increases the development team‚Äôs productivity (quicker feedback).
- Allows for different, complex types of testing.
- Improves project quality.
- Doesn‚Äôt find visual or UX bugs.

### Automated Tests Can Save You From Regressions
Software applications are susceptible to regressions. There‚Äôs no way to have confidence in the quality of your app unless you completely test it after each change.
